# Incremental Prompt — Completed Task Home Screen (State C)

Update the Home Screen to handle the state when ALL tasks for the day are completed. This is the most emotionally important screen in the app — treat it with care. Do NOT restructure other screens or logic.

---

## When to Show This State

Show this state on the Home Screen (Today tab) when:
- All tasks for today have been marked complete with proof submitted
- The user returns to the app at any point after completing their task(s)

This state persists for the rest of the day until midnight reset.

## Visual Design

### Card Transformation
- The task card shifts from its active state into a calm, settled completion state
- Card gets a soft sage green (#7DB07A) left border accent (4px)
- Background stays white but with a very subtle warm glow/shadow
- A gentle animated checkmark plays once (SVG stroke draw animation, ~600ms)
- Proof thumbnail is visible on the card (small, tappable to view full size)
- Task text stays visible but slightly muted — it's done, it's settled
- Completed timestamp below task text: "Done at 3:42 PM" in secondary text color

### Completion Message (Above the Card)
Display ONE message randomly selected per day. Store the selected index in today's entry so it stays consistent if the user reopens the app multiple times.

**Generic completion messages (default pool):**
- "Done and dusted. The rest of the day is yours."
- "One thing. Done. That's a win."
- "You showed up today. That matters more than you think."
- "Nothing left to do. How good does that feel?"
- "Today's sorted. Go enjoy the rest of it."
- "You said you'd do it, and you did. That's who you are."
- "That's it. You're free. Go do something fun."
- "Look at you, showing up for yourself."

**Streak milestone messages (override generic on these days):**
- Day 3: "Three days running. Something's clicking."
- Day 5: "Five days in. This is becoming your thing."
- Day 7: "A whole week. You've earned what comes next."
- Day 10: "Ten days. Double digits. That's real momentum."
- Day 14: "Two weeks of showing up. That's not luck — that's you."
- Day 21: "Three weeks. You're not trying anymore — you just do this now."
- Day 30: "30 days. You've built something real."
- Day 50: "Fifty days. Most people never get here. You did."
- Day 100: "One hundred days. That's not a streak — that's who you are."

**Level up messages (override everything on level-up day):**
- Level 1 → 2: "You've unlocked 2 tasks per day. You earned this."
- Level 2 → 3: "Three tasks per day. Look how far you've come."

Style the message in the heading font (Fraunces/Lora/Nunito), larger size (~20-22px), warm charcoal color, centered above the card. Fade it in with a 300ms delay after the checkmark animation completes.

### Reflection Summary (Below the Card)
After proof and reflection are submitted, show a quiet journal-style entry below the task card:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✅  "Finish the proposal draft"     │
│      Done at 3:42 PM                 │
│      [proof thumbnail]               │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘

   😌 Calm
   "Felt good to focus on just this one thing"
```

- Mood emoji displayed at regular size with the label next to it
- Reflection note in italics, secondary text color
- If no reflection note was written, just show the mood emoji — no "No note added" placeholder
- This section should feel like a peaceful journal entry, not a data display

### The Empty Space Below — Intentional

**CRITICAL DESIGN DECISION:**

After the completed card and reflection, the rest of the screen should be intentionally empty. Do NOT add:
- ❌ "Add another task" buttons
- ❌ Suggestions or tips
- ❌ Links to other features
- ❌ Motivational quotes beyond the single message above
- ❌ Any engagement hooks whatsoever

The emptiness IS the reward. The app is saying: "You're done. Go live your life."

At the very bottom of the screen, one soft line of text, centered, in secondary color:

*"See you tomorrow ✨"*

## Animation Sequence on First View

When the user first sees this state after completing their task (right after the celebration animation from the completion flow), play this sequence:

1. **0ms:** Screen transitions to State C layout
2. **0-600ms:** Checkmark draws on the card (SVG stroke animation)
3. **300ms:** Card border fades to sage green
4. **600ms:** Soft radial pulse on the checkmark (one pulse, not repeating)
5. **900ms:** Completion message fades in above the card
6. **1200ms:** Reflection summary fades in below the card
7. **1500ms:** "See you tomorrow ✨" fades in at the bottom

Total sequence: ~1.5 seconds. Should feel unhurried and satisfying.

On subsequent app opens the same day, skip the animation — show everything already in place, no re-animation.

---

## Data Tracking

Add a field to DailyEntry to persist the selected message:

```typescript
// Add to existing DailyEntry interface
completionMessageIndex?: number; // index of the randomly selected message, persisted so it stays consistent across app reopens
```

---

## Edge Case: Multiple Tasks (Level 2 or 3)

If the user is at Level 2 or 3 and has completed SOME but not all tasks:
- Do NOT show State C
- Stay in State B (active task view)
- Completed tasks show with a subtle checkmark and muted styling
- Remaining tasks stay active with "Mark Complete" button
- Only transition to State C when ALL tasks for the day are done
