# Incremental Prompt — App Logo: The Organic Check

Replace any placeholder or existing logo with "The Organic Check" logo throughout the app. Do NOT restructure existing screens or logic.

---

## Logo Concept

The app logo is a warm, hand-drawn style checkmark on a soft cream background. It feels like someone marked something "done" with a pen — human, satisfying, and approachable. NOT a corporate geometric checkmark.

---

## Logo SVG (Source)

Use this exact SVG as the app logo source. Render it at different sizes as needed throughout the app.

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1024 1024" width="1024" height="1024">
  <defs>
    <clipPath id="iconClip">
      <rect x="0" y="0" width="1024" height="1024" rx="228" ry="228"/>
    </clipPath>
  </defs>
  <g clip-path="url(#iconClip)">
    <!-- Warm cream background -->
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="1024" height="1024" fill="#FAF7F2"/>
    <!-- Organic checkmark -->
    <path
      d="M 280 540 C 300 540 380 640 420 700 C 460 640 580 400 740 300"
      stroke="#E8913A"
      stroke-width="48"
      stroke-linecap="round"
      stroke-linejoin="round"
      fill="none"
    />
  </g>
</svg>
```

### Key Visual Properties
- **Checkmark stroke color:** #E8913A (golden amber — the app's accent color)
- **Stroke width:** 48px at 1024x1024 (scale proportionally)
- **Stroke caps:** Round (stroke-linecap="round") — this is critical for the organic feel
- **Stroke joins:** Round (stroke-linejoin="round")
- **Background:** #FAF7F2 (warm cream)
- **Icon corners:** iOS-standard rounded rect (rx/ry = 22.37% of size)
- The checkmark should NOT be a perfect geometric angle — it has a slight organic curve, as if drawn by hand with a thick marker

## Where to Use the Logo

### 1. App Icon (Home Screen)
- Use the full SVG above as the app icon
- Export at all required iOS sizes: 1024, 180, 167, 152, 120, 87, 80, 60, 40
- Export at all required Android sizes: 512, 432, 324, 216, 162, 108
- The rounded corners are applied by the OS on home screen — but include them in the asset for App Store/Play Store listing previews

### 2. Launch / Splash Screen
- Display the checkmark graphic only (WITHOUT the rounded rect background) at 120x120px, centered
- Below it: "One Thing" in heading font (Fraunces/Lora/Nunito), 28px, warm charcoal (#2D2A26)
- Below that: Randomly selected tagline in body font, 16px, italic, secondary color (#8A8580)
- Background: Warm cream (#FAF7F2) — full screen

**Launch screen animation:**
1. **0ms:** Warm cream background appears
2. **200ms:** Checkmark draws itself using a stroke-dashoffset animation (dasharray = total path length, animate dashoffset from full length to 0 over 800ms with ease-out). This is the signature animation — the checkmark "writes itself" like someone drawing it with a pen.
3. **700ms:** "One Thing" text fades in (300ms)
4. **1000ms:** Tagline fades in with slight upward movement (300ms)
5. **2200ms:** Entire screen fades out (400ms)
6. **2600ms:** Home Screen fully visible

### 3. Onboarding Screens
- Use the checkmark graphic (without background) as a visual element on the final onboarding screen
- Smaller size: 80x80px
- Can have a subtle pulse/glow animation to draw attention to the CTA

### 4. Empty State on Home Screen
- When no task is set (State A), show a very faint, large version of the checkmark (opacity 0.06) as a watermark in the background center
- This creates a subtle visual goal — "this is what completion looks like"

### 5. Task Completion Animation
- When a user marks a task complete, the checkmark draws itself on the task card using the same stroke-dashoffset animation from the launch screen
- Size: 32x32px on the task card
- Color: #7DB07A (sage green) for in-card completion — use the amber (#E8913A) only for the app icon and splash
- Animation duration: 600ms with ease-out

## Color Variations

The checkmark is used in different colors depending on context:

| Context | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| App icon | Golden amber | #E8913A |
| Splash screen | Golden amber | #E8913A |
| Task completion (in-card) | Sage green | #7DB07A |
| Calendar completed day | Sage green | #7DB07A |
| Empty state watermark | Warm cream (barely visible) | #FAF7F2 at 6% opacity over background |

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Do not use a geometric, angular checkmark — it must feel organic and hand-drawn
- ❌ Do not use a filled checkmark — it's always a stroke/outline
- ❌ Do not make the stroke too thin — the thick, rounded stroke IS the personality
- ❌ Do not use the checkmark with a circle around it — it stands alone
- ❌ Do not change the curve of the check — the slight organic bend differentiates it from every other task app's checkmark
