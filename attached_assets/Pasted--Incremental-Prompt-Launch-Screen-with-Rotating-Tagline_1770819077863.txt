# Incremental Prompt — Launch Screen with Rotating Taglines

Add a warm, animated launch/splash screen that shows the Sunrise logo and a randomly selected tagline each time the app opens. Do NOT restructure existing screens or logic.

---

## Launch Screen Design

This screen appears every time the app opens, for approximately 2-2.5 seconds before transitioning to the Home Screen.

```

- **Background:** Warm cream (#FAF7F2) — same as app background, seamless feel
- **Logo:** The Sunrise app icon, displayed at 120x120px, centered, with NO rounded corners (since it's inside the app, not on the home screen). Use the raw sunrise graphic — half sun, horizon line, rays — not the icon with rounded rect mask.
- **App Name:** "One Thing" in heading font (Fraunces/Lora/Nunito), 28px, warm charcoal (#2D2A26), centered below the logo with 16px spacing
- **Tagline:** Randomly selected from the pool below, displayed in body font (DM Sans/Plus Jakarta Sans), 16px, secondary color (#8A8580), centered below the app name with 12px spacing. Italic style.

### Tagline Pool

Randomly select ONE tagline per app launch. Do not repeat the same one consecutively — store the last shown index and exclude it from the next random selection.

```typescript
const taglines = [
  "You don't need to do everything. Just one thing.",
  "One thing. One day. That's enough.",
  "Start with one. The rest can wait.",
  "Less to do. More to feel proud of.",
  "A single step is still a journey.",
  "Do less. Feel better.",
];
```

Store `lastTaglineIndex` in AsyncStorage to avoid back-to-back repeats.

### Animation Sequence

1. **0ms:** Screen appears with warm cream background only
2. **200ms:** Logo fades in + gentle scale from 0.85 → 1.0 (ease-out, 500ms duration)
3. **500ms:** App name "One Thing" fades in (300ms duration)
4. **800ms:** Tagline fades in from below with slight upward movement (300ms duration)
5. **2000ms:** Entire screen fades out (400ms duration) and transitions to Home Screen
6. **2400ms:** Home Screen is fully visible

Total duration: ~2.4 seconds. Should feel calm and unhurried — like a slow, comfortable breath.

### Easing
- All fade-ins: ease-out
- Scale animation: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) — gentle deceleration
- Final fade-out: ease-in-out

---

## Technical Implementation

- Use a custom splash/launch screen component that renders on top of the app
- Use `Animated` API from React Native for the fade and scale sequences
- After the animation completes, unmount the splash component and show the Home Screen
- This is NOT the native iOS/Android static splash — it's an in-app animated splash that runs after the native one

```typescript
// Pseudocode structure
const LaunchScreen = ({ onComplete }: { onComplete: () => void }) => {
  const logoOpacity = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
  const logoScale = useRef(new Animated.Value(0.85)).current;
  const nameOpacity = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
  const taglineOpacity = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
  const taglineTranslateY = useRef(new Animated.Value(10)).current;
  const screenOpacity = useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;

  const [tagline, setTagline] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    // Pick random tagline (excluding last shown)
    pickRandomTagline().then(setTagline);

    // Run animation sequence
    Animated.sequence([
      Animated.delay(200),
      Animated.parallel([
        Animated.timing(logoOpacity, { toValue: 1, duration: 500, useNativeDriver: true }),
        Animated.timing(logoScale, { toValue: 1, duration: 500, useNativeDriver: true }),
      ]),
      Animated.delay(100),
      Animated.timing(nameOpacity, { toValue: 1, duration: 300, useNativeDriver: true }),
      Animated.delay(100),
      Animated.parallel([
        Animated.timing(taglineOpacity, { toValue: 1, duration: 300, useNativeDriver: true }),
        Animated.timing(taglineTranslateY, { toValue: 0, duration: 300, useNativeDriver: true }),
      ]),
      Animated.delay(1200),
      Animated.timing(screenOpacity, { toValue: 0, duration: 400, useNativeDriver: true }),
    ]).start(() => onComplete());
  }, []);

  return (
    <Animated.View style={{ opacity: screenOpacity, /* full screen overlay styles */ }}>
      <Animated.Image source={sunriseLogo} style={{ opacity: logoOpacity, transform: [{ scale: logoScale }] }} />
      <Animated.Text style={{ opacity: nameOpacity }}>One Thing</Animated.Text>
      <Animated.Text style={{ opacity: taglineOpacity, transform: [{ translateY: taglineTranslateY }] }}>
        {tagline}
      </Animated.Text>
    </Animated.View>
  );
};
```

## Edge Cases

- **First ever launch:** Show launch screen, THEN transition to Onboarding (not Home Screen)
- **Returning user:** Show launch screen, then transition to Home Screen
- **Keep it skippable:** If user taps anywhere on the launch screen, skip remaining animation and transition immediately — respect impatient users
- **No network needed:** Everything is local — taglines are hardcoded, logo is bundled
