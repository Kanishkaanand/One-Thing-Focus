# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 18, 2026**

## Overview

Just Today is a local-first productivity app. We collect zero user data. Everything is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. There are no accounts, no servers, and no third-party SDKs.

## Data Collection

Just Today does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. Specifically:

- No analytics or tracking of any kind
- No user accounts or authentication
- No server-side data storage
- No third-party SDKs or services
- No cookies or web tracking

All app data — including your tasks, streaks, reflections, and settings — stays entirely on your device.

## Photos

If you choose to attach a photo as task proof, that image is stored locally on your device only. Photos are never uploaded to any server or shared with any third party.

## Notifications

Just Today uses local notifications only to send you task reminders. These notifications are scheduled and delivered entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any external service.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device via AsyncStorage. This includes:

- Profile settings (e.g., display name, reminder preferences)
- Task data (status, completion timestamps, reflections)
- Proof images you attach to completed tasks
- Streak and calendar history

## Data Deletion

- You can erase all app data at any time from Profile > Settings > Reset App Data.
- Deleting the app from your device removes all locally stored data.

## Children

Just Today is not directed to children under 13.
