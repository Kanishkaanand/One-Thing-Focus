Last updated: February 12, 2026

## Overview
One Thing is a local-first productivity app. By default, your task data stays on your device.

## Data We Process
- Profile settings you enter (for example: display name, reminder preferences)
- Task data you create (task status, completion timestamps, optional reflection)
- Optional proof images you choose to attach
- App analytics events stored locally on your device
- Error logs stored locally on your device

## How Data Is Used
- To operate core app features (daily tasks, streaks, reminders, calendar history)
- To improve app reliability using local error logs
- To understand feature usage with local analytics

## Data Sharing
- We do not sell your personal data.
- We do not share your personal data with third parties by default.
- If remote analytics or crash reporting providers are added in future releases, this policy must be updated before release.

## Notifications
If enabled, One Thing sends local reminder notifications on your device.

## Photo Access
If you grant photo library permission, One Thing can read selected images so you can attach proof to completed tasks.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- App data is stored on your device until you delete it.
- You can erase app data at any time from Profile -> Settings -> Reset App Data.
- Deleting the app also removes local app data from the device.

## Children
One Thing is not directed to children under 13.
